    "# PyCity Educational Analysis\n",

    "Consideration of class sizes and the ratio of faculty staff and student numbers would be required for the next educational budget review, to either dismiss or confirm the issues raised through analysis of these current results. The ability to compare the productivity and results of students, with a comparison of the class sizing and the teaching assistant available per student, within their budgeted amount per student. These suggestions are thought to be necessary due the unexpected grade results, where children from schools with lower budgets per student, faired better. There were other correlating features noticed which could have impacted these results, such as lower student numbers in these school and that the schools fairing better were all from Charter schools.\n",
    "    There was a general pattern of District schools, having higher total student numbers, higher budgets and allowances per child, but at every district school, the overall passing rate for maths was between 65.7% and 68.3%, the lowest maths score at a charter school was 92.5%. This suggests that either class sizes in mathematics are either too large for children to get the individual direction and time they need with a teacher or another anomaly. The budget per child is larger therefore there could be more allocated towards this to ensure District school children are at the same level as those from charter schools. Charter schools have smaller class number, smaller per child budgets but across the board better results.\n",
    "    These results indicate the allocation of funding towards the child does not guarantee better results, how this money is pent would be pertinent to correctly gauging the effictiveness of the dollar per child assessment.\n",
    "    The top 5 performers were all charter schools, with less than 2300 students, requiring the least funding, These schools should be used as a model to reduce fiscal costs and improve student productivity."
